- Description shouldn’t repeat the title, it has to explain, it should be another words
- Information description should always be under heading topic on every page, which attach to the tree of information hierarchy
- Memory (information) and understanding are two separated things.
- The information will detach by itself if we know that information not being used anymore, but not erased. The understanding is still there, just detach, so your RAM (daily working memory) have more room to operate each day.
- Don’t expect understanding branch if not understand trunk
- If you can’t create understanding through isolation (thinking or reading), try action one. Usually understanding coming after doing (act on) something.
- Before understanding, you need to accepting knowledge (information)
- The inevitable way to show a pattern is the existence of data first. (datum is one information, data is more than one). Pattern only appear in data.
- Inspiration is perishable - act on it immediately.
- I felt like I knew the answer to this question, but when I tried to explain it, I couldn't put it into words. I had a *feeling* about it, but my actual knowledge was _surprisingly hazy._
- **Make sure the title of the article/topic represent its content.** In the world of information theory, it’s important to keep this principle, because people might have not ever again visiting that link. If not possible to contain it in title, contain it in description of the article.
- Ensure that *just* the *right* amount of information appears on a screen — enough to make it relevant but not so much that it causes information overload.
- There is unavoidable concequencies of **grouping** that:
  - They are must come with group name, for reference
  - They come with definition as the reason why they are exist and setting boundary
- Since labeling abstract meaning of reality, so they must be exist. Labelling is naming.
