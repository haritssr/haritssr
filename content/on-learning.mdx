- By definition, problem is understood.
- You can not remember what you can not connect
- Make sure you are building a tree of knowledge
- Problem first, theory second is for sure way to go, as it establishes relevance, thus improving memory retention - Elon Musk
- It is important to view knowledge as a sort of semantic tree. Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e., the trunk and big branches before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to - Elon Musk
- The more you can gamify the process of learning, the better - Elon Musk
- Sometimes, doing is so much easier than thinking about doing them
- Teach the problem or problem solving, not teaching the tool
- There is a perception of easiness to some topic because you already have harder topic being learned, so maybe if we want to master something we need to master the harder things
- Impossible to checklist something that indicate you have learned if you not passing the test
- Learning is possible, but it require time and energy
- Just wanting to learn something will not make you educated because there is not time and energy applied to it
- Documentation is needed because we are a forgetful creature
- Willingness to do experiment is the key to be able to do new things.
- You are only as good as how you face your test, not how you think how you face your test

## Sign of Understanding

- Recall → Test, Questions, etc
- Make stuff → Require understanding (which more than knowledge), if not, the progress of the stuff will stuck

## Sense of Applying

The idea that certain knowledge must be useful in term of physical or non physical activity that immedietly or in the long run will shows a result. As a result of this view, students understand a lesson is useless when they don't see its use right away.

## Retention Rate

- Almost impossible having high retention of understanding in the first shot of learning
- Retention rate = percent feedback of understanding
  - E.g. → Learning 10 example but only remember and understand 8, it mean the retention rate is 80% (quite effective)

## **Asynchronous Reading**

Asynchrounous reading can solve the boredom problem in class, where some student already understand the task, but other do not. Student who understood do not have to waiting other to understand, they should spend to the next or whatever topic they should or want to study.

## Learning Is Not About Finishing, But Iteration

The urge to repeat can come from a need or curiosity. Sometimes learning is not about 'finishing', but about repetition. For those who like something (including lessons), repetition is inherent. They don't have to be told to repeat and will repeat on their own, either because they still don't understand and need to repeat, or because they enjoy what they are doing (repeating). This is called a habit. For those who inherently don't like something (lessons), there is another way, namely through routines. Routines encourage consistency. Routines must be forced and must be measured for progress, to do it requires making decisions and thinking (meaning it takes energy). Unlike 'habits' that don't need to think and make decisions before doing it, in habits we just do it (if there is a trigger). The good news is that repeated routines will produce habits. The time for routines to become habits depends on many things, but one thing is certain is that there must be a trigger.

## The Important of Absorbing Patterns as Soon as Possible

There is a fundamental problem of learning that we always never will be understanding or mastering all the tools or subjects, so it important to understand as much patterns as possible to lifting the weight in some area of subject that we are doing. We can overcome this by delegate the tools, or do it ourself by having a tree of knowledge so whenever we need the tools we have really fast access (recalling) to them.
