summary: Richard Dawkins on religion - Is religion good or evil? — Al Jazeera English
---

- Nobody can actually say for certain that anything does not exist
- The evidence of both (existence of god and unicorn) is equally poor
- On Dogmatic believe — Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the result of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice.
- I had like to raise consciousness in a gentle civilized way using rational argument from evidence
- He care about what is true, he is an educator, he is a scientist, he want people to understand the truth about the universe in which they live
- The best method is scientific method because is that look at evidence and evaluate evidence. What religion to do with other than just looking at the writings of somebody who wrote a few centuries ago, why would you bother to read those writings?
- Your meaning and dignity is up to you and me is up to me, those are not what science would answer, each person finds their own meaning in their in their own life
- Evidence is the only good reason to believe anything
- As a scientist we commited to the view that we would change our mind if evidence came along
- Ketidakmampuan untuk melakukan pembuktian terhadap eksistensi suatu hal adalah bukti ketidakadaan eksistensi itu sendiri, selama eksistensi itu belum terbukti, tidak akan pernah terbukti, atau dianggap tidak berbukti sampai terbukti
