summary: Knowledge is connection of information
---

- Knowledge is connection of information
- Knowledge is the fuel of creativity
- The more you know, the more possibilities things can be made
- Creativity requires knowledge, and knowledge is achieved by learning (if you already have knowledge) or by guessing and experimenting (if you don't have knowledge yet)
- But sometimes the knowledge is already there but can't be accessed, so he starts by guessing and trying again his own version.
- Ignorance gives rise to doubts
- The more I know, the less worry I am
