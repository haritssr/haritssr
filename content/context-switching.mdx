Disturbance create context switch

[The Science of Time Management](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-science-of-time-management-7297600e8a0e)
Flow is the absence of context blablab

  Context switching can take 40% of employee productivity time
  Human brain are syncronous, on and off, not simultaneous

  - All the time you spend to prioritize your work are the time you are not spend doing it
  - Quadratic time algorithm, with inbox that twice as full, mean you doing 4 times the work
  - Giving up doing thing in the perfect order maybe the key to getting them done
  - Productivity vs Responsiveness

      (these two principle fundamentaly in tension, recognizing this tension
      allow us to decide where we want to stike that balance)

    - Getting serious work done = minimizing context switching - Being responsive
    = reacting anytime something comes up

### Solution

- The obvious one — Minimize interuptions
- The least obvious one — group them (tasks) — Interrupt Coalescing, a.k.a Batching
  - If no [things] require a response more urgently than once an hour, say, than that is exactly how often you should check them. No more.
  - Rather than dealing things as they comes up, the system group interaction together, based on how long they can afford to wait.
  - Deffering interruptions lets a system check everything at once, then quickly re-enter a lower-power state

### Summary

- Spend less time prioritizing and more time doing
- Minimize interruptions
- Batching / Intterupt coalescing — group interruptions by how long you can afford to NOT do them and do them in that amount of time
