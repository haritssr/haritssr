- Why technology is not revolutionize education?
- There are no significance difference between different learning tools methods (moocs, animation, static graphics), as long as the content is equivalent between the two treatments, the learning outcomes are the same with all different media
- On animation in learning
  - Animation are fleeting and so you might miss something as they go by
  - Since the parts are animated for you, you do not have to mentally envision how the parts are moving
  - You do not have to invest as much mental effort which would make it more memorable
- It does not matter what happens around the learner, we are not limited by the experience we can give to students
- What limits learning is what can happen in student's head
  - This is where the important part of learning takes place
- No technology is inherently superior to any other
- Researcher spend to much time investigating whether one medium or technology was more effective than another, that they failed to investigate exactly how to use the technology to promote meaningful though processes
- The real questions, what experiences promote the kind of thinking that is required for learning?
- The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challange, to excite their students to want to learn
- Technology in education is evolution, not revolution
- The foundation of education is still based on the social interaction between teachers and students
- What really matters is what happens inside the learners head
  - and making a learner think seems best archived in a social environtment with other learners and a caring teacher
