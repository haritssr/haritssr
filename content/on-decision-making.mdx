> Is is really hard to make decision making heuristic because there is infinite choice we are making all day long and trying figuring out some rule that apply to all that possible choices

## 1. If you can’t decide, the answer is no.

- It is about the right long term decision.
- The reason is : modern society is full of options.
- We born in 150 people tribe, where if one opportunity come in, the second chance comes along (meaning no second choice/opportunity)
- If you using checklist spread sheet, forget it. You should using gut and feeling. E.g:
  - Should i married this person
  - Should i take this job
  - Should i buy this house
  - Should i go to bussiness with this person
  - Should i move to this city

## 2. Two choice, looks 50 : 50. Take the path that is more difficult and painful in the short term.

- Choosing how to split betwen two otherwise even paths
- One of this part require short term pain, but long term benefit (long term game → compound interest)
- One of this part require short term benefit, but long term pain (short game)
- Brain have tendencies to overvaluing short term benefit
- Hard choices, easy life
- Easy choices, hard life

## 3. Make the choices that leave you more equanimous (internally calm, settled) in the long term/turn

- Whatever choice that leave you calmer in the long term is usually the right one
- Cultivating peace of mind
- Peace of mind is important because it is the precursor to happiness
- Happiness is can’t chase directly
- If you chassing happiness directly, you chassing pleasure
- Pleasure eventually comes with withdrawal syndrome
