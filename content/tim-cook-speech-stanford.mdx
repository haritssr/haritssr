- Crisis tempered optimism
- Consequences have challanged idelism
- Reality has shaken blind faith
- Technology doesn’t change who we are, it magnified who we are, the good and the bad
- Be a builder
- What you build and what you create define who you are
- The best founders, the ones whose creation last and whose reputations grow rather than shrinking with passing time, they spend most of their time building, piece by piece
- Builders are comfortable in the belief that their life’s work will one day be bigger than them, bigger than any one person, they are mindful that it’s effects will span generation, that’s not an accident, in a way, **_it’s the whole point_**
- Being a builder is about believing that you cannot possibly be the greatest cause on this earth, because you are not built to last, it is about making piece with the fact that you won’t be here for the end of the story
- Your mentor may leave you prepared, but they can not leave you ready
- When your times comes, you will never be ready, but you are not supposed to be
  - Find the hope in the unexpected
  - Find the courage in the challange
  - Find your vision in the solitary road
  - Don’t get distracted, there are too many people who want credit without responsibility. too many who show up for the ribbon-cutting without building anything worth a dam, be diffrent, leave something worthy and always remember that you can not take it with you, you going to have to pass it on
- Create products and expriences that enrich people’s lives, product that intuitive and easy to use, that have unique intergration of hardware and software, that are incredibly personal
