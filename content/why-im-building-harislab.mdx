[Haris Lab](https://www.harislab.com)

- Because I want it and needed it
- Being useful to other
- Brain dump of my math and physics knowledge
- Trying to have a skin on frontend react ecosystem
- Experimenting concept as a leverage of zero marginal cost of duplication with coding which applying to my previous specific knowledge which are theoritical math and physics
- In the journey, i found the alighment with math, physics and code with reactjs (functional components) which is function. All of them have function concept, which make this knowledge transferable. (But to make a usefull app (web app) with this kind stack of knowledge, there is so many small things to know and apply, more than function)
- Well its part of reserve of knowledge, someone quoted:
  > _"If money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability."_ – Henry Ford
- If you want to know if something is important or not, try to remove it and see what happen. If removing it create catastrophy, it is important and vice versa. It is for math and physics, all scientific that maintain all engineering stuff are based on math and physics.
- Education is one of the top of recommendation message from Elon Musk to Indonesia to become great country alongside with internet connectivity and participating in creation of sustainable energy
- Indonesia bercita-cita menjadi "Indonesia Emas" pada usianya yang ke-100 tahun di tahun 2045, saya ingin Haris Lab menjadi bagian dari itu, saat itu usiaku adalah 46 tahun
- Menjadikan diriku bagian dari “9 juta talenta digital 2030” agar Indonesia tetap dapat bersaing dalam era “4.0” atau lebih ini
- Regret Minimization Framework -> If i were 80 y.o. and look back in time at now, would I be regreting not doing this thing? I thing the answer is certain, it yes. Because why not, you might not have a lot of ideas very often, and would not get a sense of Product-Market-Fit really easily since it really complicated it required experience, get in touch with the problem , desired solution, and some specific skills to build a product.
